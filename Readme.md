# Physical Design using OpenLANE SKY130
This repository contains steps to use OpenLane with the SKY130nm PDK for GDSII generation, explaining the complete top (RTL) to bottom (GDSII) flow. The flow has been carried out in the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) Linux Distribution. The examples present in most repositories on GitHub use the built-in `picorv32a` as an example to illustrate the complete flow. In this [OpenLane_Physical_Design](https://github.com/nigilmohra/OpenLane_Physical_Design/tree/main) the flow is explained along with how to generate an RTL design, add it to the OpenLane tools, and run the complete flow.

**SKY130** is the hardware industry's first open-source Process Design Kit (PDK) released by **SkyWater Technology Foundry** in collaboration with **Google**. This provides worldwide access to the IP functions and open-source ASICs. For more details refer [here](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk).

### Process Design Kit (PDK) 
Process Design Kit (PDK) is an essential collection of files and data provided by semiconductor foundries to enable Integrated Circuit (IC) designers to create designs that can be manufactured using a specific semiconductor fabrication process. The PDK encapsulates all the process-specific information and rules needed for designing and verifying circuits, ensuring that the designs are compatible with the manufacturing technology of the foundry.
| Components of PDK            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

*Google and SkyWater technology foundry in collaboration have released a completely open-source Process Design Kit (PDK). The current release is a 130nm process node. The PDK is available here* [SkyWater Open Source PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk). 

#### OpenLANE ASIC Flow
 
|  ![[The OpenLane Flow.png]]   |
| :---------------------------: |
| *Figure 1. The OpenLane Flow* |

OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow which includes various open-source components such as OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Fault, Netgen and SPEF-Extractor.
1. It facilitates to add custom design exploration and optimization scripts.
2. There are two modes of operations of OpenLANE
	1. Autonomous
		It figures the flow and push the bottom flow and wait for time based on design size and get the final GDS report.
	2. Interactive
		It performs the flow one at a time.
OpenLANE contains many sub-states. The detailed flow of the stages and sub-stages are given below.
