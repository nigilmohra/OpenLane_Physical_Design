# Physical Design using OpenLANE SKY130
This repository contains steps to use OpenLane with the SKY130nm PDK for GDSII generation, explaining the complete top (RTL) to bottom (GDSII) flow. The flow has been carried out in the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) Linux Distribution. The examples present in most repositories on GitHub use the built-in `picorv32a` as an example to illustrate the complete flow. In this [OpenLane_Physical_Design](https://github.com/nigilmohra/OpenLane_Physical_Design/tree/main) the flow is explained along with how to generate an RTL design, add it to the OpenLane tools, and run the complete flow.
